** Identifying at risk individuals for depression (supervised classification model) **

* Data: Healthy Minds Study from University of Michigan (2016-2017 academic year)
* Goal: Identifying who is at risk for depression based on existing data

** Workflow **

1. Clean data by one-hot encoding to convert categorical to numeric (if not already one-hot encoded)
2. Visualize data (Sweetviz)
3. Use PyCaret to help us preprocess data 
4. Select the most relevant features and minimize multicolinearity
5. Compare models
6. Evaluate which model is best and fine tune the models
7. Make predictions via a web app

** Technologies **

* Machine Learning Library: PyCaret
* Cleaning: Pandas
* HTML/Deployment to Heroku as an app if possible.
